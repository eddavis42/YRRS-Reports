### New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey {.unlisted .unnumbered}  
### Participation in `r {params$District_name}`  
### Middle School (Grades 6-8) {.unlisted .unnumbered}  
\raggedright

The response rate for `r {params$District_name}` was `r signif(yrbss_NM$rr_sd[(yrbss_NM$sdid=={params$District})][1], 3)*100`%.  
A high response rate produces survey results that are more representative of the student population.  
A response rate of at least 60% allows generalization of results to the entire student body. A response 
rate of 70% is excellent and allows a high degree of confidence in results. Response rates below 60% 
are considered low, and caution should be exercised in interpreting results. Low response rates 
indicate that the data may represent only students who participated in the survey and not necessarily 
the entire student body

Highlights from the New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (YRRS)  
`r {params$District_name}`   
Middle School (Grades 6-8)
&nbsp;


\par
|   Statewide results from the 2021 Middle School NM YRRS revealed both encouraging and concerning trends in New Mexico. Rates of youth alcohol use, drug use and most tobacco use decreased over the past 10 years. Trends in rates of behaviors associated with violence were mixed, as the rates of physical fighting and carrying a weapon to school both decreased, while rates of sexual and dating violence remained largely unchanged. The rate of being bullied at school decreased, while the rate of electronic bullying showed little variation.  

|   Of serious concern were the increasing rates for obesity, suicidal behaviors, and characteristics associated with mental health.

|   The COVID-19 pandemic played a big part in the 2021 YRRS. When data were collected in the fall and winter of 2021, school were facing COVID-related closures and high rates of absenteeism, resulting in decreased YRRS participation at the student and school level. COVID may also have altered student behavior, as there were fewer opportunities for social interaction, and fewer opportunities to engage in socially-related high-risk behaviors. COVID also may have affected the emotional well-being of students. The 2021 YRRS included questions about the effect of COVID on students’ lives.

|   The rate of obesity or overweight, after increasing for several years, has not increased since 2015. Rates for most violence-related behaviors have not changed greatly. However, the rate of ever being physically forced to have sexual intercourse is higher in New Mexico than in the U.S.


|   This report puts the findings for New Mexico alongside YRRS results for `r {params$District_name}`. Thank you for using this information to make New Mexico and your own community a safer and healthier place for all young people. For more YRRS results, see www.youthrisk.org.

# Appendix B: About this Report

|   This report contains results from the 2021 New Mexico Middle School Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (YRRS). The YRRS is a statewide survey of public school students in middle schools and Middle Schools throughout New Mexico.  Statewide and county level results are available at https://www.YouthRisk.org and https://www.nmhealth.org/go/youth.  In addition, school district reports have been prepared for each participating school district and have been distributed to school district offices. School districts are encouraged to reproduce and share these reports with community groups concerned with prevention and health promotion.  School district level results will not be released without express permission of the school district superintendent. Forms for requesting school district data are available at https://www.YouthRisk.org. These documents comprise a useful tool for those working on youth-related issues at the state and local level.

|   The 2021 YRRS was conducted by selecting two separate samples of student respondents. One sample was selected using a methodology that is highly comparable to that used by other states conducting Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS), and to the national YRBS methodology. For most reports of YRRS state-level data, that is the sample used to produce results. However, data from that sample cannot be used to represent sub-state areas such as counties or school districts.  In order to represent smaller geographical areas, a separate sample was drawn. This second sample allows generation of estimates for sub-state areas within New Mexico. It is this second sample that was used to generate results for this report. Because of this, rates reported for New Mexico may vary slightly from rates in other reports of state-level YRRS data. 

|   The YRRS is organized into two major content areas: risk behaviors and protective (resiliency) factors.  Risk behaviors include behaviors associated with unintentional injury, violence, mental health, tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, sexual activity, physical activity, and nutrition.  Protective or resiliency factors are measures of the positive and supportive relationships, experiences, activities, resources and values that encourage healthy youth development.  Resiliency factors and related traits include caring and supportive relationships in the family, school, community and with peers; boundaries set by the family and school; positive peer support; meaningful participation and constructive use of time in school and outside of school.
&nbsp;

# Using this Report {.unlisted .unnumbered}

|   The main section of this report consists of a series of charts illustrating results from the 2019 YRRS.  Risk behaviors are organized into modules by topic area, with each module starting with one or more line charts demonstrating change in behaviors over the years of the survey. The line charts are followed by a set of bar charts showing a comparison of risk behaviors between the state and the county or school district, a comparison between boys and girls within the county or school district, and a comparison by grade level within the county or school district. For counties or school districts with very few respondents or that haven't participated consistently in the YRRS, some of these charts may be omitted.

|   The charts about risk behaviors are followed by two sets of charts about resiliency/protective factors. The first of these two sections compares the state rate for each resiliency factor to the  county or school district rate.  The second section illustrates the relationship between risk behaviors and protective factors. This section consists of a set of bar charts, each showing the prevalence of a particular risk behavior for students with varying levels of selected protective factors.

# Understanding the Charts - and a Word about Error Bars {.unlisted .unnumbered}

|   The bar charts in this report present the percentage of students who reported engaging in risk behaviors or who reported having protective factors.  The height of the bars conveys the percentage of students reporting each trait, and provides a quick visual comparison between different groups of students reporting that trait.  A label for each bar presents the actual percentage of students who reported each trait.

|   Because of the high cost and logistical complications involved in conducting a statewide survey, the YRRS was administered to a sample of students, rather than to every single student in each school district.  Because YRRS data are from a sample of students, and not the entire student body, the results in this report are estimates.  As with all estimates, there is some uncertainty associated with each of these results.  On the charts in this report, this degree of uncertainty is represented by an error bar (confidence interval).  The error bar is the thin 'I' shaped line that extends above and below the end of each bar in a chart.  One of the major influences on the size of the confidence interval or error bar is the number of participants in the survey.  In general, this means that with more students participating in the survey, there will be a higher degree of confidence in the results (i.e., error bars will be smaller).

|   Interpretation of error bars is illustrated in the charts below.  This chart compares the New Mexico rates of binge drinking and cocaine use to the United States rates for 2019.  The chart shows that the rate of current binge drinking was 12.1% in New Mexico and 13.7% in the United States. The error bar for the estimate of binge drinking among New Mexico students extends from 12.1% to 13.9%.  This means that we are confident that the actual percentage of binge drinkers among New Mexico students was between 12.1% and 13.9%.  The error bar for the estimate of binge drinking in the US extends from 12.3% to 15.2%, meaning that we are confident that the actual percentage of binge drinkers in the United States was between 12.3% and 15.2%. 

![](Appendix_B_fig1.png){width=6in}

|   How does knowing the upper and lower limits of our error bars help us?  While it appears at first glance that New Mexico had a lower prevalence of binge drinking than the United States (12.1% vs. 13.7%), a closer look at the error bars shows a more complicated picture.  The error bars for the New Mexico estimate (12.1%–13.9%) and the US estimate (12.3%-15.2%) overlap.  Because of this overlap, we do not have a high degree of confidence that the prevalence of binge drinking in New Mexico was actually different from the prevalence in the United States.  In other words, the difference between the prevalence of binge drinking in New Mexico and the United States was not statistically significant.

|   For cocaine use it appears that New Mexico had a higher prevalence than the United States (8.4% vs. 3.9%).  The error bar for New Mexico extends from 7.2% to 9.8%, and the error bar for the United States extends from 3.2% to 4.7%.  Because the higher bound of the US error bar (4.7%) is lower than the lower bound of the NM error bar (7.2%), these error bars do not overlap.  For lifetime cocaine use, we are confident in saying that the New Mexico prevalence was higher than the US prevalence.  In other words, the difference between the prevalence of cocaine use in New Mexico and the United States was a statistically significant difference.

![](Appendix_B_fig2.png){width=6in}

|   For some small areas, error bars have been removed from this report.  With small populations, the number of students sampled can approach the total student population.  In these cases, error bars would have limited meaning because with a high percentage of students surveyed, there is less uncertainty around the estimates than error bars suggest.
